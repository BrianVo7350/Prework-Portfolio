                 <p>Quantum physics is the stud level
                    It aims to uncover the properties and behaviors of the very building blocks of nature.
                    While many quantum experiments examine very small objects, such as electrons and photons
                    quantum phenomena are all around us, acting on every scale. However, we may not be able to detect them easily in larger objects
                    This may give the wrong impression that quantum phenomena are bizarre or otherworldly.
                    In fact, quantum science closes gaps in our knowledge of physics to give us a more complete picture of our everyday lives.

                <p>Quantum discoveries have been incorporated into our foundational understanding of materials, chemistry, biology, and astronomy
                    These discoveries are a valuable resource for innovation, giving rise to devices such as lasers
                    and transistors, and enabling real progress on technologies once considered purely speculative, such as quantum computers
                    Physicists are exploring the potential of quantum science to transform our view of gravity and its connection to space and time
                    Quantum science may even reveal how everything in the universe (or in multiple universes) is connected to everything else
                    through higher dimensions that our senses cannot comprehend.

            <p>The field of quantum physics arose in the late 1800s and early 1900s from a series of experimental observations of atoms that didn't make
                intuitive sense in the context of classical physics. Among the basic discoveries was the realization that matter and energy can be thought of as discrete packets,
                or quanta, that have a minimum value associated with them. For example, light of a fixed frequency will deliver energy in quanta called "photons."
                Each photon at this frequency will have the same amount of energy, and this energy can't be broken down into smaller units. In fact, the word "quantum" has Latin roots and means "how much."
